This is the code of my final project for an Embedded Systems Design course I took.
The class was CSE121/L, it was the most time-crunchy course I ever took and I learned a lot.
This project is for an oscilloscope as mentioned in my resume's projects section.

This is only here for the purposes of providing sample code for job applications.
You are not permitted to copy this code with the intent of committing academic dishonesty.
Additionally note that a noticeable portion of this code is taken from samples provided by the course.
This sample code is cited with a slide number or video or etc, and is mostly boilerplate.

All code produced by me is located within main_cm4.c
Some portions of other included code may have been modified by me for varying purposes,
but the main code produced by me is located within that file.

Again to restate, this code is only public for the purposes of showing off
embedded c code I have produced that is not locked under NDA.
This is not a resource for those currently taking the course I produced this within.
Do not copy or steal this code for the purposes of submitting to any academic institution.
